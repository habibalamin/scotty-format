# scotty-format

This module defines better response format handling for
[Scotty](https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty).

This module has been inspired by
[scotty-resource](https://github.com/taphu/scotty-resource).

TODO... in the meanwhile checkout the
[examples](https://github.com/potomak/scotty-format/tree/master/examples)
directory.
